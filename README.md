# ProfileMapApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

Profile Mapping App Using Angular

Design and implement a web application using the Angular framework that allows users to view a list of profiles and interactively explore the addresses of each profile on a map. The application aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to navigate through profiles and visualize the geographic locations associated with each individual.

The key functionalities of the application include: Profile Display: Create a webpage that presents a collection of profiles, each comprising essential information such as the person's name, photograph, and a brief description.

Interactive Mapping: Incorporate an interactive map component that can dynamically display addresses based on user interactions. This map will allow users to see the geographical location associated with each profile.

Summary Integration: Implement a "Summary" button adjacent to each profile. Clicking this button should trigger the display of the map component with a marker indicating the precise address of the selected profile.

Map Services Integration: Utilize external map services like Google Maps or Mapbox to integrate the mapping functionality into the application. This entails setting up markers and correctly rendering addresses on the map.

User-Friendly Experience: Ensure that the application offers a smooth and intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily navigate profiles and access mapped addresses without confusion.

The successful completion of this project will result in a fully functional web application that demonstrates proficiency in utilizing Angular's capabilities to create an engaging interface for profile viewing and location mapping. The application will offer an innovative solution for users interested in exploring the geographic distribution of profiles, enhancing user engagement and interaction.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
